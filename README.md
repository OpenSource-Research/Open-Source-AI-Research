## About Open-Source-AI-Research
*Open-Source-AI-Research is an experimental non-profit project focusing on AI research in an open source collaboration mode.*

We believe honesty, communication and cooperation are the essential keys for the development of research. That is why an open source collaboration mode may be better. Here, we try to encourage anyone to take part in a research project with his/her brilliant and shining ideas or capabilities. Besides, AI research is just such an experimental field which especially needs many peoples' ideas, efforts, quick trials, errors and collaborations together.

However, because of the pressure of life and other constraints, this project may not spread or play a role at all. But for such an interesting thing, it is worth a try. Isn't it?

## Sub-project List

1. [LLM4PP-QuickStart](https://github.com/bebetterest/LLM4PP-QuickStart)

P.S.: The sub-project list may be incomplete and all sub-projects are managed by their own creators. Though each item was previously evaluated, you still ought to be *careful* of the contents and your contribution.
